Geo/Coordinates/Convert version 0.01
====================================

Geo::Coordinates::Convert provides you a function converting classical geographics
coordinates (e.g. 50.25° E, 12.3° S) to Lambert II coordinates (x meters, y meters)
you can draw easily on a flat map using translation and scaling factors.
Geo::Coordinates::Convert provides also the reverse function converting Lambert II coordinates
to classical geographics coordinates.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CAUTION

I'm not sure these subs works fine for all longitudes (despite the sub
set_Mean_Longitude), nor other latitudes, especially northern ones or equatorial ones.
I don't know the place to find the parameters $N, $C, $XS, $YS for other countries than France.
